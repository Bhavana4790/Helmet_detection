### Collected data for helmet images and annotated them for training the object detection model using yolov8.
### This repository contains train, test and valid data which can be used immediately. I am also providing data.yaml file which can be used for training the model using yolov8.

For prediction, use the code below:
```bash
from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO('best.pt') # your pretrained model
results = model(source = "video.mp4", save=True)
```
